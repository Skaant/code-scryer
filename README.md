# code-scryer

Come aboard the Code Scryer to explore, visualize and interact its codebase !

Right now, it can only crawl its own folder/files tree, but the goal is to make it a npm module to install in projects to inspect.

## Quick start

Install dependencies :

```sh
npm i
```

Run local dev environment :

```sh
npm run dev:server
npm run ds # alias

npm run dev:front
npm run df # alias
```

Build production bundles :

```sh
npm run prod:server
npm run prod:front
```

Run production server :

```sh
npm start
```
